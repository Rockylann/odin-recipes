    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just
        combined. Do not overmix, as this will result in tough pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake.</li>
      <li>
        Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes and the edges
        start to brown, about 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
