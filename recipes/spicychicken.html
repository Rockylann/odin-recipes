    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound boneless</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, combine the cornstarch, soy
        sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, chili powder, cayenne
        pepper, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Let
        marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the chicken: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook in batches until golden brown
        and cooked through, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer the cooked
        chicken to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: In the same skillet used to cook the chicken, add the
        garlic, ginger, and chili pepper (if using). Cook for about 30 seconds,
        until fragrant. Stir in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and
        cornstarch. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and toss to coat with
        the sauce. Serve immediately over rice or noodles, with your favorite
        toppings.
